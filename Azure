# Creating Your First Azure Virtual Machine

## Prerequisites
1. An active Azure account and subscription
2. Access to the Azure portal (portal.azure.com)
3. A web browser
4. Basic understanding of operating system preferences (Windows/Linux)

## Detailed Steps

### Step 1: Access Azure Portal
1. Go to portal.azure.com
2. Sign in with your Azure account credentials

### Step 2: Create a New Virtual Machine
1. Click on "Create a resource" in the upper left corner
2. Select "Compute" > "Virtual Machine"
3. Click "Create"

### Step 3: Configure Basic Settings
1. Select your subscription from the dropdown
2. Create a new Resource Group or select existing one
3. Enter a VM name (must be unique within the resource group)
4. Choose your region (select the closest to your location)
5. Select availability options (can use default for first VM)
6. Choose your operating system:
   - For Windows Server, select a Windows Server version
   - For Linux, choose distributions like Ubuntu, CentOS, or RHEL
7. Select your VM size:
   - Start with B-series for testing (e.g., B2s)
   - Or D-series for production workloads

### Step 4: Set Authentication
For Windows:
1. Create username
2. Create strong password (must meet complexity requirements)

For Linux:
1. Choose between SSH public key or password
2. If using password, create username and strong password
3. If using SSH, provide your public key

### Step 5: Configure Networking
1. Create new Virtual Network (VNet) or select existing
2. Subnet will be created automatically if creating new VNet
3. Select Public IP (create new one)
4. Keep default Network Security Group (NSG) with basic rules
5. Enable basic DDoS protection

### Step 6: Management Settings
1. Enable boot diagnostics
2. Choose managed disks for OS disk type
3. Leave other settings as default for first VM

### Step 7: Review and Create
1. Click "Review + create"
2. Wait for validation to pass
3. Review all settings
4. Click "Create"
5. Wait for deployment (usually 5-10 minutes)

### Step 8: Connect to Your VM
For Windows:
1. Download RDP file from VM overview page
2. Use Remote Desktop Connection
3. Enter credentials you created

For Linux:
1. Use SSH command provided in portal
2. Connect using terminal or SSH client
3. Use your credentials or SSH key

## Important Security Notes
- Always use strong passwords
- Keep your VM updated
- Use Network Security Groups to control access
- Enable Azure Security Center for security recommendations
- Regular backup of important data

## Cost Management Tips
- Stop VM when not in use
- Choose right size for your workload
- Use Azure Cost Management to monitor spending
- Consider reserved instances for long-term use

## Next Steps
1. Install your required software
2. Configure backup
3. Set up monitoring
4. Implement additional security measures as needed
